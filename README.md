# Spotify Clone(Frontend Only)

A **frontend Spotify clone** built using **HTML and CSS**.
This project focuses on recreating the **UI/UX layout** of Spotify’s web player to strengthen my understanding of modern layouts, flexbox properties, Overflow property positioning, and responsive design.

> This is a **static project** created for learning purposes. It does not include backend functionality or real music streaming.
